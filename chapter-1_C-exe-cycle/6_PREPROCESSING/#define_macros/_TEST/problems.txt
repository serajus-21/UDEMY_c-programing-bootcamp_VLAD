🔹 Exercise 1 (Centralized Constant + String Macro)

Write a program that displays a welcome message and a version number of an application.

Use a string macro for the application name.

Use a numeric constant macro for the version number.

Print them in the format:
AppName vX.Y started successfully.



🔹 Exercise 2 (Numeric Constant + Expression Macro)

Write a program that calculates the area and circumference of a circle.

Define a numeric macro for π.

Define expression macros for:

area of a circle

circumference of a circle

Read the radius from user input.

Display both results.



🔹 Exercise 3 (Expression Macro Discipline)

Write a program that reads length and width of a rectangle and prints its area.

Define an expression macro for rectangle area.

Prove that your macro works correctly when the arguments are expressions, not just variables (e.g., length+1).



🔹 Exercise 4 (Keyword Macro)

Write a program that performs division of two numbers with decimal precision.

Use a keyword macro to alias a floating-point type.

Read two values from the user.

Display the result with exactly two digits after the decimal point.



🔹 Exercise 5 (Single-Argument Macro)

Write a program that reads an integer and prints its square and cube.

Define single-argument macros for square and cube.

Ensure your macros behave correctly when the argument is an expression.



🔹 Exercise 6 (Multiple-Argument Macro)

Write a program that calculates the average of three numbers.

Define a macro that takes three arguments and returns their average.

Read three integers from the user.

Display the result as a floating-point value.



🔹 Exercise 7 (Unconditional Statement Macro)

Write a program that maintains two counters: success and failure.

Define a statement macro that resets both counters to zero.

Simulate incrementing the counters.

Call the macro and show that both values are reset.



🔹 Exercise 8 (Conditional / Safe Statement Macro)

Write a program that conditionally resets two variables.

Define a safe do { } while (0) statement macro that resets two variables.

Use the macro inside an if–else statement.

Demonstrate that both variables reset only when the condition is true.



🔹 Exercise 9 (Mixed Macro Usage)

Write a program that simulates a simple grading system.

Use:

a numeric constant macro for pass mark

a string macro for pass/fail messages

an expression macro to calculate percentage

Read marks from user input.

Display whether the student passed or failed.



🔹 Exercise 10 (Macro Design Exercise — Like 2.29)

Write a program that reads three integers and displays the largest value.

Constraints:

You must use macros to compare values.

No loops.

Use only if statements.

Your program must work correctly for all possible orderings of the three numbers.
